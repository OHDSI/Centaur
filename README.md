# Centaur

## Introduction

Centaur is an R package for the implementation of observational cohort studies.  It provides several alternative workflows 
to control for observed confounding by providing a set of configurable options to compute propensity scores, balance 
covariates between two exposure groups, evaluate the quality of balance and perform outcome analysis.   

Centaur also uses a more traditional approach than the OHDSI cohort method and places the 
responsibility on the user to include all observed covariates likely to have an impact on the treatment 
choice or the outcome. The cohort data is currently loaded by a user as an R dataframe and can come from any source.  It is therefore left up to the user to design the cohort appropriately.  In contrast, the OHDSI cohort method creates the cohort dataset by a direct configurable query to a CDM instance and then includes all possible exposures, conditions etc as covariates by default.  

At the same time, the OHDSI Cohort Method can also be directly called within Centaur to facilitate 
using regularized regression for cohorts with large numbers of covariates and to compare results 
using different methods to calculate a propensity score.

## Features

* Load any pre-existing cohort file as an R data frame
* Propensity score calculation via logistic regression, generalized boosted models (gbm) which treats interaction terms 
or regularized regression as provided in the OHDSI cohort method
* Coefficients of Propensity score model (for logistic regression)
* Propensity Score Trimming
* Balancing via weighting (either SMR or IPTW), matching, or stratification
* Truncation of weights
* Standard balance diagnostics in tabular and graphical form
* Outcome analysis â€“ either odds ratio or hazards ratio.
* Recommended default options for many steps, but also highly configurable settings

## Features In Progress
* load data via sql query of cdm instance (i.e. replicate
* options to run full workflow with pre-specified settings
* improved plotting

## Screenshots


The default available methods are determined by the number of covariates in the dataset, 
and the total number of subjects. These limits have largely been determined empirically based
 on performance. Depending on your available hardware, it may be feasible to use a given method
 with more (or fewer) covariates and/or subjects. Each of these limits can be overridden.

"Violin" plots show the distribution of matched and unmatched control and treatment propensity 
scores.

Using the stratification approach, compare the distribution in the treatment/control groups of a single covariate in each strata.

### System Requirements
System requirements are highly dependent on the size of the dataset being analyzed. For any "real-world"
dataset, we recommend at least a core i7 (or equivalent) and at least 8GB RAM.
